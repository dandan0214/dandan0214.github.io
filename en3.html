		<p>BabyKoala Business White Paper</p>
		<p><strong class="ys">What is BabyKoala?</strong></p>
		<p>BabyKoala is a digital currency issued on the Huobi Smart Chain using DeFei technology. It has the characteristics of "openness and transparency" and "collective maintenance" of the blockchain, while eliminating the need for complex mechanisms such as burning and dividends. There is no restriction on transaction fees. Let the digital currency no longer be virtual, return to the currency itself, and trade any amount anytime, anywhere.</p>
		<p><strong class="ys">What is the original intention of BabyKoala?</strong></p>
		<p>The primary currency market is chaotic and lacks legislative control. It has become a place for some people to collect money outside the law, hurting a lot of blockchain currency investment enthusiasts, and seriously hindering the process of digital virtual currency revolution!
		   The birth of BabyKoala is intended to end chaos and label the blockchain as "integrity and reliability", so that all currency investors can enjoy the benefits of consensus while still keeping their original intentions unchanged, and together promote the virtual currency revolution!</p>
