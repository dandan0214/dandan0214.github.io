	 <p>Technical framework</p>
<p>BabyKoala public chain is based on microservice architecture, and adopts 7-layer architecture: encryption layer, data layer, network layer, consensus layer, incentive layer, contract layer and application layer<br>

The technical cornerstone of BabyKoala provides security and anonymity guarantee for the main chain system<br>

<strong class="ys"> data layer </strong>: allows all super nodes to write their data into BabyKoala main network and build large database based on BabyKoala<br>

The network layer is used to spread messages through P2P network. P2P network is a peer-to-peer network, and it can also be a non center self-organizing network<br>

<strong class="ys"> consensus level </strong> in order to ensure the consistency of BabyKoala data, all miners need to confirm the order of transaction packaging through consensus mechanism<br>

<strong class="ys"> incentive layer </strong> in order to ensure the efficient operation of BabyKoala, all miners will obtain equal proportion of block rewards according to the pay ratio while paying their calculation<br>

The contract layer is the basis of BabyKoala's programmable characteristics. All developers can define contract operation rules. After the contract is published, it will be open, transparent and tamperable<br>

<strong class="ys"> application layer </strong>: run on the contract layer paper, and establish decentralized application through script and code of contract layer to enrich BabyKoala ecological construction<br>

At the same time, the user can interact with IOS through PC browser, Android and IOS through Alax, HTML and CSS protocol; Service layer: it mainly includes gateway. Spring boot server is balanced by flow control load, and load balance is found through Dubbo RPC service to realize intelligent provisioning of resources: storage layer: realize data security storage by mysql, redis, fastdfs and other technologies to ensure user privacy</p>
