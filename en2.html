	 <p>Solution</p>
	
	<p>Libra, a digital currency issued by Facebook, is also a form of defi, which is positioned to provide basic financial services for 1.7 billion people on the edge of Finance around the world; From another perspective of decentralized finance, SF stands in the position of large-scale middle-class investors and low-level investors with limited funds, and tries to solve the difficulties faced by the global ordinary investors and the current financial system: monopoly, regionalism, opacity and privacy protection by building an open community of decentralized high-quality investment products. SF is a new generation of institutional decentralized financial infrastructure. Its birth has brought dawn to the financial ecology of hundreds of millions of ordinary investors in the world</p>

<p><strong class="ys">To be specific, SF has thoroughly solved the pain points and problems of the current financial ecology through the following aspects, and has brought the real financial ecological services to the global small and medium-sized users: </strong></p>

<p><strong class="ys"> 1) wider global financial services: </strong></p>

<p>Institutional service providers create and release low threshold high-quality investment products for global investors. Anyone can easily obtain SF financial services through the Internet or smart phones, which breaks through the strict regulatory restrictions in the traditional financial field and the strict restrictions on user identity, wealth and region</p>

<p><strong class="ys"> 2) cross border circulation of barrier free funds: </strong> </p>

<p>SF establishes a new monetary and financial system, which provides a convenient channel for the flow of funds. The value transfer can be realized through the pass, which not only breaks through the regional regulatory restrictions, but also bypasses the expensive transfer agencies, effectively reducing the cost of cross-border capital circulation</p>

<p><strong class="ys"> 3) transaction non tamperability: </strong></p>

<p>The SF system ensures that the transaction is unchangeable, and the underlying network cannot be closed by the central organization. At present, the global political and economic situation is unstable, the financial system is seriously threatened, the global high-quality investment goods are scarce, and the wealth of citizens in some countries with severe fluctuations can not be effectively protected. People can use SF to protect and create their own property</p>

<p><strong class="ys"> 4) information transparency and privacy protection: </strong></p>

<p>In SF, the information is highly transparent. The source, flow direction and value of each fund will be recorded and stored in all users' computer systems synchronously; At the same time, the user's personal privacy information data is protected by high-intensity encryption, and the public transaction data after desensitization can be queried by individuals and third-party audit institutions</p>
